in a newly created folder/app

what we want to store for an item
for example the title description price and similar infos

when we added items and created a urls file for items to navigate the items url/directory we add it to the main project urls.py file
when we have successfully added the items url to the main project urls path whenever the item directory is pursued it'll go to that directory through
the main project urls file to the items urls file to the destination page/view
